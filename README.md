# AI-based Suspicious Transaction Detection

## Overview
This project is an AI/ML-based system designed to identify potentially suspicious
financial transactions using transaction-level data. The system analyzes uploaded
datasets and generates a report highlighting suspicious activity along with
supporting visualizations.

The project was developed as part of a national-level cybersecurity hackathon
organized by the Madhya Pradesh Police 

## Live Model
**Web Application:** https://dynamic-devs.streamlit.app/

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions process large volumes of transaction data, making manual
analysis difficult and time-consuming. This project aims to assist in identifying
potentially suspicious transactions using automated analysis and basic machine
learning techniques.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset available in this repository.
2. Open the web application using the link above.
3. Upload the downloaded dataset to the application.
4. The system will generate:
   - A suspicious transaction report
   - Visualizations and graphs for analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib

## Output
- Classification of transactions as normal or potentially suspicious
- Summary report of flagged transactions
- Graphical insights into transaction patterns

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational and research purposes only and is not
a production-ready financial fraud detection system.
